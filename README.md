# Youtube Playlist Organizer
Adds the title of all the videos of a playlist, along with their links, creators and durations, to a google sheet so that they can easily be sorted through their durations. This was created so as to go through a huge 'watch later' playlist and start watching videos according to the amount of free time available at the moment of watching.
